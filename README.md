# Auto DocsDB
This repository contains a script that automates the tedious process of manually moving marks from eClass to DocsDB at the University of Alberta's Computing Science Department. 

## Preliminaries
This system has only been verified using Python 3.9.0. 
This system has only been tested using firefox. *In Theory* it should work with any browser, but you're on your own to figure that out.


1. Please create a virtual environment with this version of python or greater, and install the requisite libraries using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` after activating your environment.
2. You will also need to install the appropriate drivers to interact with the browser. Download them from (here)[https://www.selenium.dev/]

## Usage
Just run `python script.py` after performing the above preliminary steps.
